# My Resume in LaTeX (Swedish & English)

This project contains my resume in both Swedish and English, created using LaTeX. LaTeX provides a professional and structured way to design documents, and this project showcases how it can be used to produce a clean, well-formatted resume.

## Contents
- `cv_ux_eng.tex`: My resume in English.
- `cv_ux_swe.tex`: My resume in Swedish.
- `cv_ux_eng.pdf`: The compiled Englishresume in PDF format.
- `cv_ux_swe.pdf`: The compiled Swedish resume in PDF format.

## How to Compile
To compile the LaTeX files into PDF, you can use a LaTeX editor or compile via command line using the following commands:

```bash
pdflatex cv_swedish.tex
pdflatex cv_english.tex
```

## About the Project

This repository serves as a demonstration of my LaTeX skills and a showcase of my professional background in both languages. Feel free to explore the source code to see how different LaTeX features are used to format a bilingual resume.
